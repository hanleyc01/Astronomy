# Astronomy Project

In this project we will be, because of our lack of knowledge on the subject,
doing some basic statistical analyses of the differing Messier objects. Specifically, 
seeing if there is, by a linear regression, some significant relation between the Messier 
object's *flux* and their *distance*. Accompanying this analysis will be some cool graphs 
that we came up with which plot out the distances of each Messier object, because
we're amateurs, and all of this information, even though it might be relevant,
or might confirm things which have already become common knowledge within the field,
will be very interesting :)

Our Messier object data is taken from (starlust)[https://starlust.org/messier-catalog/].
